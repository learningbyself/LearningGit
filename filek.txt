Software development life cycleThe process to develop the software is called as SDLC	¥	Requirement Collection:Requirement CollectionRequirement CollectionFeasibility StudyFeasibility StudyHLD (High Level Design)HLD (High Level Design)DesignDesignLLD (Low Level Design)LLD (Low Level Design)CodingCodingMaintenanceMaintenanceInstallation / DeploymentInstallation / DeploymentTestingTesting	There are various models present in SDLC:	¥	Waterfall Model	¥	Spiral Model	¥	V Model( Verification and Validation)	¥	Prototype Model	¥	Hybrid Model	¥	Agile MethodologyCustomer ( City bank) wants are software. Thus, They request for proposal from different company. Companies (Infosys, TCS, Wipro) gives  proposal customer accepts the best proposal (Wipro)  as they have domain experts.Once the proposal is accepts customer and company signs something called,SLA: Service level AgreementMSA: Master level AgreementA person who gather requirement from service based companies is called Business Analyst.A person who gather requirement from product based companies is called as Product AnalystBusiness Analyst from company goes to customer place and start gathering the requirements, prepare a rough document called as Customer Requirement Specification (CRS) and comes back to company and convert it into a detailed document called as Software Requirement Specification (SRS).SRS also can be called as BRS ( Business requirement Specification)           BRD: Business Requirement Specification           FS: Functional Requirement           FRS: Functional Requirement Specification           NFRS: Non Functional Requirement SpecificationIn agile it called as, Product backlog or sprint or stories or story cards.	¥	Feasibility Study:CustomerCustomerPMPMFinance/ AccountsFinance/ AccountsHiringHiringBenchBenchHRHRHLDHLDArchitectArchitectSr. DeveloperSr. DeveloperBABA Business Analyst gives the requirement to Architect.  Architect will ask how many users are expected based on that he will decide about number of servers, we call it as High Level designNow, its moved to Senior DeveloperHe/She will decide about,	¥	Number of developers and number of test engineers	¥	The platform that applications going to be developE.g. 20 developers and 15 Test EngineersThen, The requirement is moved to HR.HRÕs will check the resource available in the bench. If the resources are not available in the bench then they planned for hiring.Then the requirement is moved to Accounts or Finance team.The team will calculate overall budget like,  Server Cost, Resource Cost,Infrastructure CostNow, The requirement is moved to Project Manager. Project manager along with BA will talk to customer.Customer will negotiate the project and once done the project is kicked off.	¥	Design: 	¥	DB serverDB serverCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankDB serverDB serverCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity BankCity Bank    It contains codes like HTML, CSS and JavaScript- App server process the request, It contains codes like Java, J2EE- Database server stores all the data. It contains SQL tables.	¥	Low Level Design:          LLD means it is a detailed design of each and every module of an software.          It is prepared by senior developer.ICICIICICIErrorErrorErrorErrorDisplayDisplayReturn_data.javaReturn_data.javaCreateSession.javaCreateSession.javaValidate.javaValidate.javaLoginLogin      	¥	Coding:  It is done by developer whenever developer start the development he will refer the lower level design and the requirement.	¥	Testing:Testing is done by Test Engineer. Test engineer. Founds the bug &sends it to the developer.Developer will open the low level design & check for which module or which set of code is having a bug. Developer will open the source code & fix the bug & sends it to the test engineerTest engineer will verify the bug is fixed or not & he will re-test it.	¥	Installation / Deployment:    Who does the deployment?               It depends on project:	¥	Multiple installation, Then it is done by Field engineer.	¥	Single Installation, Then it is done by Infrastructure Team	¥	Product based software then it is done by customers/ Users	¥	Maintenance:Maintenance will have 3 activities	¥	Update 	¥	Bug Fixes	¥	Support
